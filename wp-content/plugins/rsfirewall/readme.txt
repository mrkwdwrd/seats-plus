RSFirewall! will compare the MD5 hash of files with the original ones from the WordPress installation package. If differences are found (ie files have been modified) RSFirewall! upon request can download the original files from the GitHub synchronised repository of WordPress:

[https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/)

All connections are made with [wp_remote_get](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_remote_get) and the following information will be sent along with the request:
- WordPress version
- WordPress user agent along with your WordPress website address
- Your server's IP address

== Installation ==

Upload the RSFirewall! plugin to your blog and activate it. Out of the box protection is supplied upon activation but it's always wise to check out the Configuration area to view all options available and perform a System Check to ensure your website's integrity.
